# 69-Detector
Searches your screen for any text containing the number 69. When found, it opens a window saying "Nice." Completely useless haha. 

# Tesseract Info
Tesseract OCR is what this script uses to read onscreen text. It is originally written in C somethin, i dont remember. My script uses the python wrapper, pytesseract.
Tesseract can be installed @ https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-v5.0.0-alpha.20210506.exe (clicking this link will automatically start the installation.)
