# 69-Detector
Searches your screen for any text containing the number 69. When found, it opens a window saying "Nice." Completely useless haha. 
IMPORTANT: Requires Tesseract installation and it needs to be in C:\Program Files\

# Tesseract Info
Tesseract OCR is what this script uses to read onscreen text. It is originally written in C somethin, i dont remember. My script uses the python wrapper, pytesseract.
